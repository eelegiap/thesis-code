        <span class="tooltiptext">This visualization requires a word to be selected (clicked) in the texts. Once a word
            is selected, the alignment explorer displays three related concepts from left to right: 1) the number of
            times that the selected word is not translated as the immediate translation (the aligned translation), 2)
            the number of times that the selected word is translated as the immediate translation, and 3) the number of
            times that the immediate translation is not translated as the selected word. <br>Hovering over segments of the
            visualization will provide specific information on the frequencies of these phenomena.</span>

        <span class="tooltiptext">When you click on a word, this panel displays all the instances in which the word and
            its corresponding translation are used in the text as a whole. Dots more to the right represent instances of
            the word later in the text. The dots in blue correspond to the selected word in the source text, while the
            dots in red correspond to the selected word in the translation text. <br>This panel provides to the user data
            about word frequency and spread. Furthermore, this panel (in conjunction with the “Alignment Explorer”)
            helps users determine how often a selected word and its immediate translation appear together in the text.

        <h6>Google N-Gram Viewer (Usage over time)</h6>
        <span class="tooltiptext">Mining a select corpus of texts, the Google Ngram Viewer displays the frequency with
            which a given word has been used from 1800 to the present. When you click on a word, WADL feeds the selected
            word and its corresponding immediate translation into Ngram, and displays a chart showing the frequencies of
            the words. The blue line is the frequency of the source document word, while the red line is the frequency
            of the translation document word. You can hover over the graph to judge the divergence between the frequency
            of the words at a given time. You can also select a line or label to gray out the other line. Our intention
            in providing this data is to assist translators and literary scholars in determining whether the selected
            word and its translation closely correspond.
